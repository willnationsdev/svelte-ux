'svelte-ux': patch

Fix SelectField MenuOption icons no longer being passed to MenuItems. Fix SelectField `fieldClasses` not being incorporated into the inner `TextField` properly. Update SelectField docs page with colored example that differentiates icon & input color, both in the field and the menu items.
